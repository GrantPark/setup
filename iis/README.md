## HTTP Logging

In IIS, optionally activate daily logging per site to the D:\IISLogs folder.

Delete periodically or disable after a period of time so that the log files don't fill up the server storage.  


## Transferring IIS Settings From One Server to Another

In order to transfer settings from one IIS server to another, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Ensure that both servers are running the same version of IIS. A minor version difference such as 11.3 versus 11.5 may be OK. If you try to restore the settings from a server with a major version difference, such as version 8 to version 11, the restore may fail. Trying to restore from a backup of settings made on the new server prior to the restore from the old server may fail as well. You will then have to uninstall IIS, physically delete it from the file system, and then re-install it again on the new server.

You still may see an error code indicating failure, but hopefully you'll be able to see the restored settings in IIS. Perhaps the error code resulted from the SSL certificates.</li>
</ol>
